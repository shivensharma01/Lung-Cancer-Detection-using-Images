# Lung Cancer Detection Using Images

## 📌 Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques to detect lung cancer using medical images (CT scans or X-rays). The model is trained using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** and **Vision Transformers** to achieve high accuracy in classifying cancerous and non-cancerous lung scans.

## 🚀 Features
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes CNNs and Vision Transformers for image classification.
- **High Accuracy:** Optimized model achieving state-of-the-art performance.
- **Efficient Preprocessing:** Data augmentation and normalization for better generalization.
- **Scalable Implementation:** Can be deployed in real-time medical diagnostic systems.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **TensorFlow / PyTorch**
- **OpenCV**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**
- **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset consists of labeled lung scans, sourced from **public medical datasets** (e.g., Kaggle, NIH).
- **Preprocessing:** Normalization, augmentation, and resizing of images.
